--------Sergio design measures-----------------------------

* doc_urdf_sergio.pdf:
	- 	Contains a technical drawing of the sergio measures gain from 
		the 3D inventor design.
	-	Of each point the x,y and z coordinates can be generated using
		torso_measures_NX.m
	-	The origin is placed at the top of the base top plate in the 
		center of the wheel basis.

* torso_measures_NX.m, an.m, di.m:
	-	To get the distance between point A and B, use di(A,B)
	-	To get the angle between point A to B to C use an(A,B,C)
	-	Note, orientation of the coordinate system is, x to the left of 
		the robot, y to the back of the robot, z to the top of the robot.
	-	All torso rotation points are projected on the center plane 
		spanned by the y and z axes.

* sergio.pdf:
	-	Is auto generated by running the update.bash script
	-	Contains the complete transfer function tree of the urdf model
	-	Note, the rpy angles can differ from the xacro defined values,
		because for example rpy=pi pi 0 is equal to rpy=0 0 pi
